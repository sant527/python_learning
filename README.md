## Q: List changes unexpectedly after assignment. How do I clone or copy it to prevent this?

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2612802/list-changes-unexpectedly-after-assignment-how-do-i-clone-or-copy-it-to-prevent
> While using `new_list = my_list`, any modifications to new_list changes my_list everytime. Why is this, and how can I clone or copy the list to prevent it?

### Answer PART1: List changes unexpectedly after assignment

**Trying to Assign mutable objects**
```
m = list([1, 2, 3])`
n = m
```
Since, python lists are mutable, m and n will still be reference to the same object after mutation. Whereas, for immutable objects like int, a new object will be created and the identifier will refer to the new object.

With `new_list = my_list`, you don't actually have two lists. The assignment just copies the reference to the list, not the actual list, so both `new_list` and `my_list` refer to the same list after the assignment.

**Answer PART2: How do I clone or copy it to prevent this**

However, if you need the original list unchanged when the new list is modified, you can use the copy() method.

`newlist = [*mylist]` also is a possibility in Python 3. `newlist = list(mylist)` maybe is more clear though.

`new_list = original_list.copy()`

The ids of new_list and original_list is different.

#### Understanding mutable vs immutable

**Mutable**

`lists, dictionaries and sets` are mutable , meaning you can change their content without changing their identity. Custom classes are generally mutable.

Trying to change mutable objects
```
# Python code to test that 
# lists are mutable 
color = ["red", "blue", "green"] 
print(color) 

color[0] = "pink"
color[-1] = "orange"
print(color) 
```

**Immutable**

These are of in-built types like `int, float, bool, string, unicode, tuple`. In simple words, an immutable object canâ€™t be changed after it is created

```
tuple1 = (0, 1, 2, 3)  
tuple1[0] = 4
print(tuple1)
```
>Traceback (most recent call last):
>  File "e0eaddff843a8695575daec34506f126.py", line 3, in 
>    tuple1[0]=4
>TypeError: 'tuple' object does not support item assignment

## Python Classes

### To create a class, use the keyword class:

```
class Person:
  def __init__(self, name, age):
    self.name = name
    self.age = age

  def myfunc(self):
    print("Hello my name is " + self.name)

p1 = Person("John", 36)
p1.myfunc()

```
> Note: The `self` parameter is a reference to the current instance of the class, and is used to access variables that belong to the class.


### Create Object
Now we can use the class named MyClass to create objects:

Example
Create an object named p1, and print the value of x:
```
p1 = Person("John", 36)
p1.myfunc()
```

## Python getattr()
The `getattr()` method returns the value of the named attribute of an object. If not found, it returns the default value provided to the function.

**The syntax of getattr() method is:**
```
getattr(object, name[, default])
```
The above syntax is equivalent to:
```
object.name
```

**getattr() Parameters**  
getattr() method takes multiple parameters:  
`object` - object whose named attribute's value is to be returned  
`name` - string that contains the attribute's name  
`default (Optional)` - value that is returned when the named attribute is not found

**Return value from getattr()**  
getattr() method returns:  
`value` of the named attribute of the given object  
`default`, if no named attribute is found  
`AttributeError` exception, if named attribute is not found and default is not defined

**Example 1: How getattr() works in Python?**
```
class Person:
    age = 23
    name = "Adam"

person = Person()
print('The age is:', getattr(person, "age"))
print('The age is:', person.age)
```
Output
```
The age is: 23
The age is: 23
Example 2: getattr() when named attribute is not found
class Person:
    age = 23
    name = "Adam"

person = Person()
```
**when default value is provided**
```
print('The sex is:', getattr(person, 'sex', 'Male'))
```
**when no default value is provided**
```
print('The sex is:', getattr(person, 'sex'))
```
Output
```
The sex is: Male
AttributeError: 'Person' object has no attribute 'sex'
The named attribute sex is not present in the class Person. So, when calling getattr() method with a default value Male, it returns Male.
```
**But, if we don't provide any default value, when the named attribute sex is not found, it raises an AttributeError saying the object has no sex attribute.**
