## Q: List changes unexpectedly after assignment. How do I clone or copy it to prevent this?

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2612802/list-changes-unexpectedly-after-assignment-how-do-i-clone-or-copy-it-to-prevent
> While using `new_list = my_list`, any modifications to new_list changes my_list everytime. Why is this, and how can I clone or copy the list to prevent it?

### Answer:

**Trying to Assign mutable objects**
```
m = list([1, 2, 3])`
n = m
```
Since, python lists are mutable, m and n will still be reference to the same object after mutation. Whereas, for immutable objects like int, a new object will be created and the identifier will refer to the new object.

With `new_list = my_list`, you don't actually have two lists. The assignment just copies the reference to the list, not the actual list, so both `new_list` and `my_list` refer to the same list after the assignment.

#### Understanding mutable vs immutable

**Mutable**

`lists, dictionaries and sets` are mutable , meaning you can change their content without changing their identity. Custom classes are generally mutable.

Trying to change mutable objects
```
# Python code to test that 
# lists are mutable 
color = ["red", "blue", "green"] 
print(color) 

color[0] = "pink"
color[-1] = "orange"
print(color) 
```

**Immutable**

These are of in-built types like `int, float, bool, string, unicode, tuple`. In simple words, an immutable object canâ€™t be changed after it is created

```
tuple1 = (0, 1, 2, 3)  
tuple1[0] = 4
print(tuple1)
```
